#Source of libtorrent nuget package

There are a couple of ways libtorrent can be acquired. I choose to download and build it via vcpkg.
The output binaries have been added to the nuget package cource repository. 
The builds are only available for Winwows x64 systems ( both release and debug, and both static and dynamic libraries.)
The pre-built binaries of boost library have also been attached to the corresponding bin and lib folders.
The nuget package will be available on the official nuget server soon under the name of drkr-libtorrent.
